QuickBooks - Bookkeeping System

## Project Overview
QuickBooks is a simple bookkeeping system designed to demonstrate  development capabilities, system architecture design, and UI/UX skills. This project was developed as part of a technical assessment, showcasing both architectural planning and practical implementation.



### Technical Stack
- **Frontend:**
  - React.js with JavaScript
  - State Management: React Hooks
  - Styling: Tailwind CSS
  - Data Visualization: Recharts
  - Real-time Updates: WebSocket ready

- **Backend Design:** (Architecture Only)
  - RESTful API Design
  - Node.js/Express or Python/Django
  - PostgreSQL/MongoDB for data storage
  - AWS S3 for file storage

## Features Implemented

### 1. Interactive Dashboard
- Real-time financial metrics visualization
- Revenue vs Expenses comparison
- Expense breakdown analysis
- Responsive design for all devices

### 2. User Interface Components
- Animated navigation with mobile responsiveness
- Interactive hero section with particle effects
- Dynamic form handling
- Modal implementations
- Search functionality
- Responsive grid layouts

### 3. Data Visualization

## Future Enhancements
1. Authentication implementation
2. Real-time data synchronization
3. Advanced filtering capabilities
4. Export functionality
5. Advanced reporting features

## Testing Approach
The project is structured to support:
- Unit testing with Jest
- Integration testing
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- End-to-end testing capability

## Performance Considerations
- Optimized bundle size
- Code splitting ready
- Efficient state management
- Cached responses
- Lazy loading implementation

## Security Measures
